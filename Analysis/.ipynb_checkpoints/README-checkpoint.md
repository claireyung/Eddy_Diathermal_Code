# Notebooks 
Used to calculate MHT and DHT at different timescales

Some calculations done in submitted job scripts as they were too big to do at once/interactively.

Also: 
- `Checking_things`: numerical mixing calculation in ACCESS, scale analysis (to ignore small terms), comparison of binning schemes
- `idealised(0D)`: idealised 0D sinusoidal model
- `PBS Script`: .py and .sh scripts to run processing scripts
- `resolution_comparison`: 1 degree and 0.1 degree output (only 1 year of monthly data), plus analysis notebook
